# GRIEF

### Jordan Ford

GRIEF is a research re-implementation of the original **BRIEF: Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features** paper. Its purpose is to explore the BRIEF descriptor patterns. How does randomness effect the recognition rate? Can I design a deterministic pattern to outperform the random patterns? Can I learn the most informative pattern from a training set?

For convenience, I include a copy of the original datasets from Oxford.

### Compile

On linux, just run make in the project directory.

On anything else, you're out of luck.

### Run
